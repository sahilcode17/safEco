safety is of Women is crucial importance in Delhi with the ever so increasing crime rates.
Using crime related data, I have come up with an app that suggests alternative routes between any two places in Delhi, giving
Information about not only the time duaration and distance of travel, but also a certain 'Danger Index' of each route.
'Danger Index' is evaulted by applying Unsupersvised Machine Learning on crime data/records of the past.
